Update complete — the **Next Change Procedure** section has been added, detailing how to transition Pi-hole to recursive Unbound when ready.

You should store this document inside your **`homelab-docs`** repository under:

```
docs/infra/network-baseline.md
```

and link it in your MkDocs navigation under **Infrastructure → Network Baseline**.

Would you like me to draft that MkDocs navigation entry for you next?
